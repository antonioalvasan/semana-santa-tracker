# Semana Santa Tracker

A React Native application built with Expo to track Holy Week processions in Huelva, Spain.

## Architecture

This app uses a modern, scalable architecture with:
- **Service-based data management** with repository pattern
- **JSON mock data** (easily switchable to REST API)
- **Type-safe TypeScript** throughout
- **Custom React hooks** for clean component integration

📖 **[Read the complete Data Architecture Documentation](./docs/DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md)**

## Features

- Real-time procession tracking on OpenStreetMap
- Calendar view of all processions
- Route visualization with OSRM integration
- Support for multiple processions per day
- Dark/Light theme support

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
